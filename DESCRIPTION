Description: Various actuarial science functionalities, mostly in the
  fields of loss distributions, risk theory (including ruin theory),
  simulation of compound hierarchical models and credibility theory.
  The package also provides support functions for 19 continuous heavy
  tailed probability distributions useful for insurance loss severity
  modeling, as well as zero-truncated and zero-modified extensions to
  the discrete distributions commonly used in loss frequency modeling.
